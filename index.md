# What is this thing?

This isn't really a website, and it's not really a blog. It's more-or-less a
place that allows me to share ad-hoc notes via the interwebs.

The notes stored here will usually be about [Practicing
Ruby](http://practicingruby.com), but they may also be about other 
stuff on occasion.

If you want to track when updates are made to this website, check out its
[repository 
on Github](http://github.com/elm-city-craftworks/notes.practicingruby.com). 

If you want to discuss something with me, you can [email
me](mailto:gregory@practicingruby.com), or tweet something to
[@practicingruby](http://twitter.com/practicingruby).
