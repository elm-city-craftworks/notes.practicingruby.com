<p>Saying something nasty or mean-spirited does not make you a bad person in the eyes of the world. In fact, for most people, most of the time, negative interactions tends to be sandwiched between positive ones, and so they fade away as quickly as they arise. The larger our social networks are, the more this tends to be the case, because we can quickly get over our own bad behavior by having good exchanges with folks who were unaffected by what we did.</p>

<p>Within a couple days, we feel fine again, and most people we interact with regularly will chalk our mistakes up to us having a bad day, and let it go. All of this makes it easy to forget that the people we hurt (and those who are close to them) may not recover so quickly. Sure, you can apologize for what you did, and when done well it helps, but there is no such thing as taking back what you said.</p>

<p>So the next time that person sees something from you, the fact that you hurt them will still come to mind. It could be months, or years later, but that person will remember. In the best case scenario, they’ll see you doing something wonderful: and that will perhaps change their mind about you to “Oh, this new thing is from that guy who was a jerk to me, but it looks pretty cool”. With enough time passing by, and dozens of positive interactions (even if they’re indirect), the person you hurt may eventually decide that maybe you aren’t so bad afterall, and that they were just an unlucky victim of poor circumstances.</p>
