# {{ page.title }}

*A single day online course with Gregory Brown
from [Practicing Ruby](http://practicingruby.com). (will be run in late July or early August 2013)*

You're a programmer, and you're also passionate about sharing your 
knowledge and experience with others through your writing. But 
the drive to teach others is both a blessing and a curse, isn't it?

Even if you're a master programmer (most of us aren't!), you will
quickly find that there is no easy way to simply take your ideas
and put them into someone else's head. Instead, you need to build
a bridge between what they already know and the new stuff you're
trying to teach them. To do that, you need to be able to step
into your reader's shoes and see the world the way they do.
This is a skill that can take years to master, and many amateur
technical writers never bother to learn it at all.

While there are no shortcuts on the path to effective writing,
there is a lot you can do to get yourself pointed in the right
direction. As someone who's been writing technical content 
professionally for almost a decade now, I would love to help
you do exactly that.

The courses I teach are not academic in nature. If you participate
in a session with me, you can rest assured knowing that you
will not be beaten over the head with a copy of *Strunk & White*,
nor will we be rocking out to the tune of Schoolhouse Rock's
[Conjunction Junction](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODGA7ssL-6g).
Instead, I'll be helping you figure out how to take what you've
learned about programming and make it useful to others in a clear
and engaging way.

Rather than selling you a list of vague promises in the form of shallow
marketing copy, I'll tell you right now exactly how I run my courses,
so that you can decide if it's right for you. Saddle up though,
there is no tl;dr; to summarize the takeaway. If you feel the need
for that, or if you get bored rather than inspired while reading
what follows, just close the page! We both know that would mean
this course wouldn't be right for you.

If do you read all the way to the end of this post and find yourself 
excited about what I'm offering, don't hesitate to submit an 
application. I'm only accepting four students for this workshop,
and I expect it will fill up before the deadline!
 
## What to expect from this workshop

After your application has been accepted and you're all paid up, 
you'll be given two projects to work on in advance: an open-ended writing 
prompt for a 4-6 page article, and a reading exercise where you compare an early
stage draft of a real article to its finished product to explore
what was changed and why.

Once you complete your writing exercise 
(a few days before the course starts), you'll receive a nicely organized
case study that walks you through the two versions of the provided 
sample article and explains the tradeoffs involved in the changes
that were made. After reading this case study, you'll be able to
look back on your own article and get some ideas for how it can
be improved.

By the time you make it this far, you'll almost certainly have learned 
a lot, but the live session didn't even start yet! But because you've
prepared yourself so well, you'll get a lot more out of those few
hours of live collaboration than you would have otherwise.

On the day of the course, we'll meet together in a Campfire chat,
starting off with a brief warmup exercise to set the theme for
the day. Then, we'll jump right into having you critically review 
the articles written by your fellow students: after
all, it's much easier to spot flaws in other people's work than
it is in your own. Because everyone in this course will
be working towards a common goal, peer feedback will provide
a powerful opportunity to improve while maintaining a friendly
learning atmosphere.

Of course, you'll probably want to hear my own thoughts on your 
work as well, since I'm the "expert" you've paid good money to 
learn from. Rest assured: I will read every article before the
course begins, and take comprehensive feedback notes on them.
Anything your fellow students miss in review, and anything I
have a different opinion on, I will share before the course
is complete.

Once we're done with the review phase of the session, you'll
then search for some low-cost, high-impact changes you can
make to your draft within a couple hours, and you'll proceed
to make those changes. This is the most important part of the
course, because it forces you to put what you've learned into
practice, even if it's just one small step to get you started
with.

We'll then wrap up with a brief group discussion on what everyone
learned from the course, followed by optional private interviews
(~20-30 minutes) with me. If you do decide to meet with me, we can 
discuss how to apply what you've learned from the course to your 
own projects, or if necessary, clear up any lingering questions 
you have that you feel weren't fully addressed during the course.
You can even ask me questions about my own work practices --
as long as it helps you get better at technical writing, any
topic is open for discussion!

And there you have it: a fully personalized and deeply educational
master class that can teach you lessons that will stick with you
for a lifetime. If you're serious about technical writing,
I doubt you'll find something like this anywhere else.

## How to apply

*Participating in this course will cost you $450, with a full 
refund guaranteed if you don't have an awesome experience.*

To apply, please send 
a sample of your writing along with a brief note about why you're
interested to [gregory@practicingruby.com](mailto:gregory@practicingruby.com)
by July 1, 2013. I will evaluate applications on a first-come, first-serve
basis and there are only a maximum of four slots open -- so be sure
to send your application in as early as you can. Keep in mind
that your writing sample does not need to be perfect, it just
needs to show me that you have basic English writing skills
and intermediate experience with at least one programming language.
 
If you're accepted to participate, I'll follow up over email with
a few questions that will help me prepare the course, and then we'll
find a date and time period that works best for the whole group to meet. Roughly
speaking, I expect we'll run the session in late July or early August, so
only apply if you expect to be generally available then.

If you have any questions, please feel free to email before applying. I look
forward to hearing from you. :-)

*PS: If you expect that this course will be well worth its $450 price
tag, but aren't in a financial position that would allow you to 
comfortably pay the full amount, you can request a discounted rate 
(or even a free seat!) after I've reviewed your application. But to avoid 
biasing my selection process, please don't 
request a discount until you've received an acceptance email from me.*
