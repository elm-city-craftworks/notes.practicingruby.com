1. Steer clear of bullshit in all its forms
2. Serve needs and desires, not cravings
3. Prefer win-win deals over zero-sum games
4. Avoid harmful actions, even profitable ones
5. Be both trusting and trust-worthy

I wish I could say it is easy to run a successful business and adhere to all
five of the above precepts at all times, but life is not that
simple. But if most people, most of the time tended to follow these guidelines,
the world would be a better place, wouldn't it?
