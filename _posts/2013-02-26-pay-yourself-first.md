The difficult thing about a labor of love is that love isn't exactly 
a transferrable currency. You can't eat love, nor can you use it to pay your
mortgage or your car insurance. Although that's  obvious when it's
laid out plainly, it is a big part of what makes it hard to transition a side
project into a real business that you can make a living from.

For the first year or so of working on Practicing Ruby, I wasn't especially
concerned with how much money it was making. It was meant to help keep a trickle
of revenue flowing while I worked on Mendicant University, and to slow down how
quickly I was pulling from my savings to support my volunteer work. It
definitely served that purpose, allowing me to stretch a short runway into a
long one while simultaneously building something valuable for others.

But if you want something to be truly sustainable, you can't just stretch
it -- you need to grow it. This is the thing I overlooked with Practicing Ruby,
and soon enough that lead me into some dark times. At first, I wasn't tracking
the number of hours I was working on it because it didn't matter; later I wasn't
tracking them because they embarrassed me. And if I wasn't tracking the time I
was putting into it, you could be sure that I wasn't even looking at its revenue 
and expenses!

For as long as I can remember, I've been proud of my cavalier attitude towards 
business. I always believed that it's the product and the people that matter, 
not the money, and that's still an unbroken part of my DNA. But at the same
time, if you rely on making enough money to get by in order to keep a project
afloat, ignoring the fact that it *is* a business will only lead to its
demise. Seeing how easily that could happen with Practicing Ruby, I decided
that keeping the doors open was more important than preserving some kind
of idealistic notion about how economies *ought* to work.

The resulting changes were tiny and incremental. I started by tracking my time
for a few months... just to see how much effort was going into the service,
and what exactly I was pouring that energy into. At that stage, I wasn't
really thinking about money yet, but it still influenced me in big ways. For
example, I started to ask myself if spending six weeks and 30+ hours on a 
single article was really worth the effort, or if I should be trying to find 
topics that were less of a stretch for me to write on. I also found that
even on topics that I was not familiar with, I could spend 6-8 hours editing
a contributed article and produce something even better than what I could
have done myself. These little optimizations happened automatically,
simply because I was forced to look at how I was spending my time.

Next came revenue reports, which I set my wife up to take care of for me. How
much money was coming in the door each month? What were our costs? After giving
Jordan his small commission, how much money did I actually take home in a month?
These are all questions I was afraid to investigate, because I knew that the
answer was "Not Much". When $2500+/month of gross revenue turns into a $1100
paycheck, it seems kind of disheartening, but ignoring that fact doesn't make it
any less real.

Next came time investment caps, which were perhaps the best influence of all.
Forcing myself to estimate at the beginning of each month how much time
I wanted to invest into Practicing Ruby made a huge difference, because
it forced me to work within those constraints. It didn't matter if I told
myself I'd be spending 80 hours that month or 50 hours, what *did* matter
is that I had a solid metric to remind me that each hour I spent had value,
and that I should use it wisely.

Finally, I decided I needed to split up my role as a business owner, and
my role as an employee. As an employee, I wanted predictable hours and
a clearly established pay rate. As a business owner, I wanted to make
sure that my business was making more money than what it was spending,
and that I making progress towards the goals I set for myself
(both financially and developmentally). Since the business itself
wasn't doing that well, I had to offer my employee self a very low rate
to start with: $30/hr. Because I couldn't even afford that based on
the operating costs, I moved some money from my savings into my
business account as a cushion to cover the small losses that I
anticipated would start to accumulate. I decided that when that
money was gone, I'd either need to make a specific, conscious choice to
invest more or make a big change.

All of this is just mental gymnastics. I'm a one person business if 
you don't count my minor responsibilities to others, so there is
no *real* separation between my business and personal income. However,
by getting some visibility into how much time and money were flowing
through the business, it inspired me to make some major changes.
The time caps and setting a pay rate on my work were especially
helpful, but they wouldn't be possible to establish without
the basic time tracking and revenue reports I enacted earlier.

The end result of all of this? Well, it still remains to be written. 
But as a result of these changes, the business is gradually turning
itself around to be cash-flow positive, and it looks like it's
starting to grow again. With that in mind, I'm going to start
doing regularly scheduled, gradual raises to my pay rate,
until it gets somewhere close to feeling equitable. I don't
expect to be making the $150-$200/hr I did as a consultant, but I
do want to make more than the $15/hr I was making from Practicing
Ruby a year ago, and the $30/hr I'm making now. I don't think
that would have ever been possible without these changes, but
I'm *much* more optimistic now.

I guess this is growing up. And man, does it feel good!

*PS: For those wondering, I'm also going to be teaching a few
online courses to help with my short-term cash flow. I just
completed one on Tech Writing over the weekend that went
AWESOME, and I think I'll be able to do those every couple
months throughout the rest of the year*
