title: How to kill an idea

# {{page.title}}

Some people suffer from a lack of ideas, others suffer from an overabundance of
them. I struggle with the latter, and it's downright embarrassing how much energy
my daydreams have stolen from my daily work. The struggle to maintain focus is a
constant one, requiring both vigilance and willpower.

I've learned the hard way that **saying yes** to every new idea that pops into my mind
ends up leaving me flat like a pancake. It's a surefire way to end up with tons
of half-starts and a few almost-done projects that never quite end up getting
shipped.

With some practice, **saying no** is easier, and probably less painful overall.
However, it is still an exercise in self-control: you need to convince yourself
that what you're working on now is more important than the vague
ideas in your head, and that's not a simple thing to do. The greenfield project
has not revealed its pain points yet, while the
work-in-progress is a briar patch full of unresolved issues.

Because **yes is dangerous** and **no is painful**, sometimes it's best to take
the middle road. To do that, you don't make a decision right away, but instead
tell yourself **"Let's see how it goes"**. Budget a few hours for exploration,
and then let yourself work on the new project a little bit, as long as you
treat it as the lowest priority task. Don't announce it or commit to it, but
instead, just play with it.

The sobering insights that come along with a small amount of real 
work will often lead your new idea to a swift (yet painless) death. When
that happens, you're then free to move on without remorse -- you've 
proven to yourself that the grass isn't greener
on the other side.

But what about those ideas that survive the **"Let's see how it goes"** test?
Well, those ones might just be worth your time and energy!
