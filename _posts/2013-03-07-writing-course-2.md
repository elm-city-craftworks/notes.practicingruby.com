# {{ page.title }}
*A single day online course with Gregory Brown
from [Practicing Ruby](http://practicingruby.com). (will be run in late April or early May 2013)*

Back in February, I ran a single day technical writing course that I 
designed from scratch for four participants. It was a huge success: every
student left happy, and the tiny class size made it possible for me to
really connect with each of them.

During the course, everyone reviewed each other's work, and then made
revisions to their own content based on what they learned. I also 
shared a case study from Practicing Ruby that explained 
the "how and why" behind various changes I made to a contributed article
in order to transform it into an excellent finished product. 

In addition to these two main activities, I also conducted individual 
interviews with students at the beginning and end of the course, so that 
they could privately ask me whatever questions they wanted about tech writing.
For a session that lasted only eight hours, we definitely covered a lot of ground!

Because this course was great fun for me, and because the students 
responded so well, I've decided I want to try this again. If you're
a programmer who wants to improve your technical writing skills, you
should apply for the next session! In particular, this course might be a good
fit for you if you're working on any of the following things:

* Writing blog posts, articles, or even books
* Producing documentation for commercial projects or F/OSS projects
* Preparing written materials for technical courses

I've been writing professionally for nearly a decade now, so no matter what your 
goals are, I will probably be able to help you. You don't need to be a great 
writer (or even a great programmer) in order to participate, as long as 
you are passionate about getting better at both of those things.

**The cost of this single day course that will be custom built for you
is only $300, with a full refund guaranteed if you don't have 
an awesome experience. A student in the last session
said he'd pay up to $500 without hesitation for what he learned from the
class, so you can expect a great deal of value for your money!**

To apply, please send 
a sample of your writing along with a brief note about why you're
interested to [gregory@practicingruby.com](mailto:gregory@practicingruby.com)
by March 1, 2013. I will evaluate applications on a first-come, first-serve
basis and there are only a maximum of five slots open, so be sure
to send your application in as early as you can!

If you're accepted to participate, I'll follow up over email with
a few questions that will help me design a good course for you, and we'll
find a date and time period that works best for the whole group. Roughly
speaking, I expect we'll run the session in late April or early May, so
only apply if you expect to be generally available then.

If you have any questions, please feel free to email before applying. I look
forward to hearing from you. :-)

*PS: If you expect that this course will be well worth its $300 price
tag, but aren't in a financial position that would allow you to 
comfortably pay the full amount, you can request a discounted rate 
(or even a free seat!) after I've reviewed your application. But to avoid 
biasing my selection process, please don't 
request a discount until you've received an acceptance email from me.*
