*(Inspired by both Dieter Rams and ISO/IEC 9126)*

Sustainable software is...

**Purposeful:** It has a real, well-defined problem it needs to solve.

**Reliable:** It consistently works correctly under normal circumstances, and handles failures gracefully in exceptional circumstances.

**Unobtrusive:** It is pleasant to work with, not ugly or distracting.

**Safe:** It is secure from malicious attacks, and also helps the user avoid accidents.

**Learnable:** It is a result of careful design considerations that help both its users and maintainers understand how it is meant to work.

**Interoperable:** It plays nice with others, and avoids unnecessary roadblocks at its integration points.

**Flexible:** It is either easy to change, or designed in such a way as to not need to be changed in order to be extended.

**Testable:** Its behaviors can be readily verified, in a reliable and consistent way.

**Usable:** It is built for a particular audience, and attempts to meet their needs in a natural and efficient manner.

**Portable:** It expects as little as possible from the environment it is meant to run within. When possible, it is not tied down to particular device or platform.

Whenever we're teaching or learning the craft of software development, we should be thinking about which of these goals we're trying to satisfy. If it is none of them, we've lost sight of the forest for the trees.
