# {{ page.title }}

Today I promised to reveal the plans for Practicing Ruby's 
seventh volume. You can scroll to the bottom of this message
to see what exactly will be changed in the coming months,
but the "behind the scenes" notes below will help explain
*why* those changes are being made. Please read them if
you have the time to do so!

## Some notes from behind the scenes at Practicing Ruby

The very best articles that I've published in this journal 
are the ones that I had enough time and energy to really 
fall in love with. These issues were ones where I didn't 
need to count the hours invested into the draft or pay 
attention to the ship date; I was free to experiment 
with various kinds of ideas -- even those that might end 
up failing in the end.

But truthfully, a good portion of the content I've 
produced has not been under these idyllic conditions. 
In fact, I often deal with conditions that are quite the 
opposite, for any number of reasons. Here are just a few, 
to give you a sense of what goes on behind the scenes:

<pre>
- A contributed article will fall through or be pushed 
to a later date, and suddenly I have just a couple days 
to come up with a new  article from scratch to fill its place. 

- I will invest dozens of hours of research and development
into an idea, only to find out that it's not nearly as 
interesting of a topic as I thought it would be.

- I will get started on what I am sure will be a *great* 
article, only to have a family issue crop up, or catch a 
cold, and then have my available working time cut into a 
fraction of what I expected it would be.
</pre>

You all are engaged in creative work, so I'm sure many of these 
problems sound familiar to you, albeit in a different context.
With that in mind, I won't elaborate further on my own 
difficulties, and instead, I'll turn my focus to what all of 
this means for you.

The bottom line is that when the production schedule puts 
strains on me, I tend to produce articles which are just
"good enough", rather than "knock-your-socks-off great!". 
For a different kind of product, this would probably not 
be an issue, but for Practicing Ruby, I think I owe you more 
than that. I sold you the idea of Practicing Ruby on the basis
of it being a unique learning resource that will give you a 
kind of deep enrichment you won't find anywhere else; and so
that's what I want to keep giving you.

Throughout Volume 6, I played around with different content 
formats, trying to find ones that kept the spirit of 
Practicing Ruby alive while reducing the necessary time 
investment. I think that of the various things I tried out, 
the recipe-style format was most promising, but it still didn't 
come close to matching the quality and depth of my very best 
long-form articles. Were they interesting lessons? Sure, at least 
some of them were. But did they inspire the same kind of "Wow!"
moments that my best work is capable of producing? No, I don't
think so -- at least not as much as I had hoped they would.

All of this tells me there is only one thing left for us 
to try: we need to take Practicing Ruby back to its roots, at a pace 
that will allow me to slow-cook things rather than rushing 
against deadlines.

## So what will change, exactly?

For Volume 7, I will be changing the publishing schedule 
so that new articles are released on the first Tuesday of 
every month, rather than every other Tuesday. I will also be 
reducing the frequency of these news updates, consolidating them 
into a single in-depth post on the third Tuesday of each month.
These changes will free up enough time for me to return the 
traditional article style that we've been fine-turning over the 
years, rather than continuing on with experimental content formats.

The bet I'm making here is that "less frequent, but better" content
will not only allow Practicing Ruby to survive over the coming 
months, but that it will actually cause it to thrive. I
believe that a slower pace will restore my own passion in this
project, and that will in turn allow me to build a much better
and more consistent learning resource for you. I have lots of ideas of
where to focus my energy if this change does have as good of an
effect on my availability as I expect it will, but I'll reveal those 
later, once we can all agree the core content has really hit 
its stride.`
